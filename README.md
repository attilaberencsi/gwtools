# Gateway Tools for UI5 / Fiori

## About 
Gateway Helper Tools for Fiori Developers, Application Managers and DevOps colleagues to speed up recurring DevOps tasks in development and quality/test systems from a central place.
Very plain, simple and old-school, because it is designed for copy-paste :). 

### Motivation
Beeing in this industry for a while, my mind is time to time about how-to simplify admin work of DevOps. 

## Features
- Wipe Client (SMICM) Cache
- Wipe Global (Auth/Nav) Cache
- Wipe Metadata Cache - Backend + FrontEnd
- Show Active SICF Services
- Show Inactive SICF Services

## Installation
- Pull this repo using ABAPGit **OR** 
- copy-paste report source: zgw_tools.prog.abap into a GW (FES) or S/4HANA System. 

Not all developers are able to use ABAPGit behind corporate walls, therefore only a single report **ZGW_TOOLS** is to be created only.


## Test results
### ATC
- Passed

### Functional
- Validated on ABAP 1909 successfully
